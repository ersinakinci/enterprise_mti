Enterprise MTI
==============

Add multiple table inheritance with database-backed referential integrity to your Active Record models.

About
-----

Enterprise MTI is a Ruby library for adding multiple table inheritance to your Active Record models.  Unlike other MTI libraries, its design enforces referential integrity at both the application and database levels.  The library's name, its architectural principles, and some of its code are derived from [Dan Chak's](http://dan.chak.org) excellent book, [*Enterprise Rails*](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Rails-Dan-Chak/dp/0596515200).

Current status
--------------

Enterprise MTI only supports PostgreSQL at the moment but is designed in a way to allow for other RDBMS's to be supported in the future.  MySQL isn't supported because it doesn't offer deferred constraint checking.

The library also only supports one-to-one associations at the moment, but one-to-many and many-to-many support is actively being worked on.

How does it work?
-----------------

Enterprise MTI deals with three types of models and their corresponding tables:

* **Superclass**: The parent (ancestor) model and its table
* **Subclasses**: The child (inheriting) models and their tables
* **Container class**: The model that appears to have direct access to the subclass models

For example, given a container class `Closet`, a superclass `Shoes`, and subclasses `RedShoes` and `WhiteShoes`, you can do this:

    closet = Closet.new
    closet.shoes = RedShoes.new || WhiteShoes.new
    closet.red_shoes = RedShoes.new
    closet.white_shoes = WhiteShoes.new
    closet.build_white_shoes
    closet.create_red_shoes

Etc.

Installation
------------

Using RubyGems:

    gem install enterprise_mti
    
Or, place it in your Gemfile along with a supported database...

    gem 'enterprise_mti'
    gem 'pg'       # supported
    #gem 'sqlite'    unsupported
    #gem 'mysql'     unsupported
    
...and install with Bundler:

    bundle install

Setup (summary)
---------------

1. Create superclass model and migration
2. Create subclass models and migrations
3. Create container class model and migration
4. Create Enterprise MTI migration
5. Migrate DB
6. Start enjoying the awesomeness

Setup (details)
---------------

**1. Create superclass model and migration**

Add `is_a_superclass` to the model.  No modification to the migration is necessary.

    class Shoe < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      is_a_superclass
    end

If your subclasses are contained within a module, use the `module:` option:

    class Shoe < ActiveRecord::Base

      is_a_superclass, module: 'Physical::Clothing'
    end

**2. Create subclass models and migrations**

First, in the same directory as the superclass model's source file, create a subfolder named after the superclass plus the suffix `_subclasses` and move your subclasses into it.

    models earksiinni$ ls
    closet.rb               red_shoe.rb             shoe.rb                 white_shoe.rb
    models earksiinni$ mkdir shoe_subclasses
    models earksiinni$ mv red_shoe.rb ./shoe_subclasses
    models earksiinni$ mv white_shoe.rb ./shoe_subclasses
    models earksiinni$ ls
    closet.rb               shoe.rb                 shoe_subclasses
    models earksiinni$ ls shoe_subclasses/
    red_shoe.rb             white_shoe.rb

Then modify your subclass models so that they inherit from your superclass.  No modification to the migration is necessary.

    class RedShoe < Shoes
    end
    
    class WhiteShoe < Shoes
    end

**3. Create container class model and migration**

Add one of the relationships defined by Enterprise MTI between the container and the superclass to your container class.  No modification to the migration is necessary.

    class Closet < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      has_one_superclass :shoe
    end

Currently, only `has_one_superclass` (i.e., `has_one`) is defined.  Using `has_one_superclass` effectively means that the container model is in a one-to-one relationship with the children of the superclass model.

If your superclass is contained within a module, use the `module:` option:

    class Closet < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      has_one_superclass :shoe, module: 'Physical::Clothing'
    end

**4. Create Enterprise MTI migration**

Create a migration that runs `enterprise_mti_up` and `enterprise_mti_down` when migrating and rolling back, respectively.

    class StartEnterpriseMti < ActiveRecord::Migration
      SUBCLASS_TABLES = ['red_shoes', 'white_shoes']
    
      def up
        enterprise_mti_up superclass_table: 'shoes', subclass_tables: SUBCLASS_TABLES
      end
  
      def down
        enterprise_mti_down superclass_table: 'shoes', subclass_tables: SUBCLASS_TABLES
      end
    end

**5. Migrate DB**
 
    rake db:migrate

**6. Start enjoying the awesomeness**
 
    closet = Closet.new
    closet.shoes = RedShoes.new || WhiteShoes.new
    closet.red_shoes = RedShoes.new
    closet.white_shoes = WhiteShoes.new
    closet.build_white_shoes
    closet.create_red_shoes
    
Contribute
==========

Please!  The following are especially needed at the moment:

* More spec tests
* Support for more databases
* Support for one-to-many and many-to-many associations
* Code cleanup

Issue a pull request and start hacking!
